Howework Details:
Write a python program to find the route between two cities using A*-search algorithm.
Details:
- Program will get 2 inputs:
- 1st input: list: [from_city, to_city] , i,e: [Istanbul,Ankara]
- 2nd input: string: “distances.csv” → File name containing containing
connections and distances between cities
- Program call will look like:
calculateRoute([Istanbul,Ankara], “distances.csv”)
- Program will print the route (separated by a single dash (“-”) and total
distance:
Output: Istanbul-Izmit-Bolu-Sakarya-Ankara,458
- The .csv file (i.e., distances.csv) containing distances between cities has the
following format. Each line in the file will show source-city name, destination-city
name and distance. Distances are the same in both direction (i.e., Istanbul-Izmit
distance is 103 km and Izmit-Istanbul distance is 103 km).
The file will look like this:
distances.csv
Istanbul,Izmit,103
Izmit,Adapazari,53
Adapazari,Bolu,125
Bolu,Ankara,187
Ankara,Kirikkale,73
Kirsehir,Kayseri,135
Isparta,Antalya,126
- You should represent the distances in an undirected weighted graph (or tree)
- Program should be able find distance and route between any reachable cities.
